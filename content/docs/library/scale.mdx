title: Scale your snapshot
description: You can scale your snapshot to any multiple
---

<Callout title="Warning" type="warn">
  The `scale_factor` is a multiple of the original size, so if you set it to 6,
  the snapshot will be 6 times larger than the original size. We recommend using
  a scale factor of 3, as it maintains high quality while keeping the size
  manageable.
</Callout>

By default, CodeSnap will take a snapshot of your code at 3 multiples of the original size.

You can change this by using the `scale_factor`:

```rust
let snapshot = CodeSnap::from_default_theme()?
    .scale_factor(6) // [!code highlight]
    .content(code_content)
    .build()?
    .create_snapshot()?;
```
