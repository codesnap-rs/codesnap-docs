This document explains the architecture of CodeSnap.

CodeSnap generates code snapshots directly from graphic engine, so it can used without network connection, it's different from other tools that use webview to render the code snapshot.
Thanks for `tiny-skia` engine make this easier.

## Syntax Highlighting

CodeSnap uses `syntect` for syntax highlighting, which is a Rust port of the Sublime Text syntax highlighter. It provides support for a wide range of programming languages and themes.

And CodeSnap also supports VSCode themes, there have a [theme-converter](https://github.com/codesnap-rs/theme-converter) to help you convert your VSCode theme to CodeSnap theme in runtime.

## Output formats

CodeSnap supports multiple output formats, including:

- PNG
- SVG
- HTML

## Themes

CodeSnap is a customizable tool, so you can create your own theme by customize `Background` and code-theme file.
