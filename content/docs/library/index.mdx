## Quick Start

Welcome to the "Getting Started" guide for CodeSnap! ðŸŽ‰ This page will help you get started with CodeSnap.

CodeSnap is a powerful tool for creating beautiful code snippets. It allows you to customize the appearance of your code snippets, making them visually appealing and easy to read.
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up CodeSnap in your project and using it effectively.

CodeSnap also provides CLI and editor plugin support, allowing you to integrate it into your development workflow seamlessly.

## Installation

```bash
cargo add codesnap
```

## Basic Usage

```rust
use codesnap::config::{CodeBuilder, CodeSnap, Content};

pub fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let code_content = Content::Code(
        CodeBuilder::default()
            .content(r#"pub fn main() {}"#)
            .language("rust")
            .build()?,
    );

    let snapshot = CodeSnap::from_default_theme()?
        .content(code_content)
        .build()?
        .create_snapshot()?;

    // Copy the snapshot data to the clipboard
    snapshot.raw_data()?.copy()
}
```
